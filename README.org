#+title: Checkrs

A utility to quickly check the =git status='s of a number of projects.

** Installation
For a quick installation process, use =cargo install --git=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo install --git ssh://git@github.com/Lazytangent/checkrs.git
#+END_SRC

** Build from Source
Clone the repository.

From the root of the repository,
- Run =cargo build= to build the binary in debug mode,
- Run =cargo run= to quickly run the program
- Run =cargo install --path .= to install the program from the local repository
** Configuration
Set your configuration file in =~/.config/checkrs/config=. The expected filetype
of the file is just text or txt.

An example file could look like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
~/.config
~/.config/nvim
~/.vim
~/dotfiles
~/.config/doom
#+END_SRC

** Roadmap
*** Support for comments in the config file
*** Generating the directory and config file for a first time user
*** Prompting the user to add the first entry to the config file
*** Support for other environment variables to be used in the path
